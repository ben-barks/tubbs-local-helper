# tubbs-local-helper
solo project - Tubbs' local helper


Original brief by Codeclan cohort E29 "shop inventory"

The goal is to create an inventory app for internal use of a shop. 

Chosen flair is Leage of Gentlemen, the shop sampled is the "local shop" with the creepy brother-sister couple.

The languages used are tagged in the repo as well: HTML/CSS, Ruby, Sinatra, PG, SQL

MVP functionality includes tables for inventory and sources, CRUD functions for both, and low on stock/out of stock
markers.

CSS and extensions to be added later.
